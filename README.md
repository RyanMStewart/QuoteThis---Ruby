# RubyProjects
I created this project in order to help keep track of my stock positions throughout the day without having to open another application on my phone. 
Being that this is just the first version, this project will take stock symbols from the user on the CL, look up the current value, then send them to a phone number as an SMS message.
The next version will iterate through an array of stock symbols at set times of the day and send a text with the value of each one.

# RubyProjects
I created this project to help keep track of my stock positions throughout the day without having to open another application on my phone. 
This is just the first version that will take stock symbols from the user on the CL, look up the current value, then send them to the phone number listed as an SMS message.
The next version will iterate through an array of stock symbols and send a text with the value of each one.
